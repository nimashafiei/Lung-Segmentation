Description: This repository contains Python code for segmenting lung CT scans. The code uses the pydicom library to read in DICOM images, and then applies various image processing techniques such as normalization, K-means clustering, erosion, dilation, and label extraction to isolate the lungs from the rest of the image. The resulting binary mask is then applied to the original image to highlight the lungs.

Readme:

Lung Segmentation in CT Scans using Python
This repository contains Python code for segmenting lung CT scans.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
Pydicom
Matplotlib
Numpy
Scikit-image
Scikit-learn
OpenCV
Usage
To use this code, clone the repository and install the required libraries using pip. Then, run the lung_segmentation.py script with the path to the DICOM image file as an argument.

bash
Copy code
python lung_segmentation.py /path/to/image.dcm
The script will output a series of images showing the intermediate steps of the segmentation process, as well as the final result.

Credits
This code is based on the lung segmentation algorithm described in this article by Akshay Chavan.
